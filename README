To install this little app:

* Place the files in a folder on your webserver
* Create a folder called 'photos' (for some reason GIT removed the empty folder from the source)
* add your geo-tagged photos.

REMEMBER - This is a first draft and will contain bugs. I am working on them as I go and will make new commits each time. Please feel free to log an issue or suggestions to this and I will see what I can do
